# Zam
An experimental general-purpose programming language inspired by Rust, but more relaxed. Featuring static typing, generics, traits, and more.
## Planned Features
- C interop
- Compile Time Evaluation for niche cases
- Interpreter cus duh? CTE will require it
## Status
TLDR; its chopped

Currently, Zam is far from it's usable state. Type checking is pretty much non existent. Only syntax level things are done (*its a lie*). Not to mention, I still have to fw with LLVM.
## Building/Running
As with most Rust projects, you just do `cargo run` or `cargo build`. However, you might come accross LLVM related issues. For that, I suggest referring to the Inkwell docs.
## Why?
TLDR; im exceptionally delusional

First and foremost, I'm a hardcore Rust glazer. As expected, I had this extreme delulu of writing my own cross platform code editor so I went ahead and failed miserably. This language is also a pure delulu. Wanting something like Rust but with extra niche things. I quite don't like lifetime specifiers in rust and all the hell including with it. Sure, I may be thoroughly cooked when trying to decide lifetimes without the said thing. But who's stopping me? I'm lowkey delusional. Whether I succeed or fail, I'm curious as to see where my journey leads.
